Initial setup vite/tailwind/daisy-ui

In data fetch i use rtk query ,
for login and signup option functionality use-> redux async thunk in userSlice.ts 

 ##userSlice.ts ->> in userSlice extraReducers came from reduxTollkit to handle pending /fulfilled/ rejected 
 //***[ 22-88(7:30)]
 
normal reducer handle The reducers object defines two reducer functions:
setUser: This reducer is designed to update the user's email in the state. It takes the state and an action as parameters. 
The action.payload is expected to contain the new email value.
setLoading: This reducer is designed to update the loading state. 
It sets the isLoading state property to the value provided in action.payload.

// extraReducers-->
The extraReducers block handles actions generated by asynchronous operations, commonly used with Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk. In this code, it seems like the actions createUser.pending, createUser.fulfilled, createUser.rejected, loginUser.pending, loginUser.fulfilled, and loginUser.rejected are being handled.
Each .addCase() call within extraReducers corresponds to different stages of these asynchronous actions:

pending: When the action is in progress.
fulfilled: When the action successfully completes.
rejected: When the action encounters an error.
Each case's corresponding reducer updates the state accordingly. For instance, createUser.pending sets loading to true and clears any previous error state. createUser.fulfilled updates the user's email and sets loading to false if successful. createUser.rejected updates error state and sets loading to false in case of an error.

 createUser and loginUser actions are referenced but not defined. 
 These actions should be created elsewhere using Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk function to handle asynchronous operations like API calls.
 





 









# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
